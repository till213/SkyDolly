  * Export pilot names
  
### Improvements

- Import
  * The aircraft selection combobox is now editable, with basic autocompletion support

  * Basic header data ("H records") import (pilot names, glider type and ID)
  * Basic position ("B records (fix)") import
  * Basic task ("C records") import (waypoints)

### Bug Fixes

- Typo: plural of aircraft is aircraft (credits: Stefano Caporelli, Youtube comment [Sky Dolly - Formation Flying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op_zTfM3-HQ&lc=UgyZXpfBxZ5iLpqnd5F4AaABAg))
- KML import plugin
  * "Flight augmentation" (adding flight procedures, aircraft attitude etc.) does properly terminate when imported flight duration is less than 3 minutes
  * Validate the number of imported positions
  * Show a simple error message in case of import failure

## 0.8.5

### New Features

- KML import plugin which imports KML flight data from flightaware.com

### Bug Fixes

- Dates and times are now properly displayed using the system locale (e.g. "8/5/2021" or "5.8.2021" for dates like "August 5 2021",
  "5:35 PM" or "17:35" for times)
  * Date and time table items are now also properly sorted, regardless of their "locale representation"
- Logbook: the date column of the "date chooser widget" is now properly resized according to its content (month names)

## 0.8.4

### Bug Fixes

- The initial velocity when recording a new formation aircraft is now properly set (indicated airspeed, as opposed to true airspeed)
  * Note that the conversion from true to indicated airspeed is currently done with a "rule of thumb" only
  * https://www.pilotmall.com/blogs/news/how-to-calculate-true-airspeed-and-what-it-is-guide
  * Depending on the altitude and especially pressure there might still be a substantial difference to the actual indicated airspeed
- Export
  * Illegal file path characters are replaced by _ in the initially suggested file path
  * KML export: exported character data (title, description) is properly enclosed in a CDATA tag
- Properly update AI aircraft when deleting the user aircraft during replay

## 0.8.3

### Bug Fixes

- The main window is now made a "parent" of the KML export dialog, making sure that the export dialog is always centered and on top of the main window
  * Especially when the "Stay on Top" option is enabled for the main window
- The initial velocity in "fly with formation" replay mode is now properly set
  * Properly converted from feet/s to knots
  * Properly converted from true to indicated airspeed (the SIMCONNECT_DATA_INITPOSITION structure really seems to expected indicated airspeed)

## 0.8.2

### Bug Fixes

- Starting the recording of the first aircraft directly in the Formation module would "teleport" the aircraft to be recorded right to the North Pole (0/0 longitude/latitude)
  * The "relative initial recording position" calculation now properly checks the returned "null position" value

## 0.8.1

### Bug Fixes

- Creating new logbooks works again
  * an attempt was made to create a backup before migration of a non-existing database

## 0.8.0

### New Features

- Plugin architecture
  * Import CSV plugin
    - Aircraft can now be _added_ to existing flights ("multiplayer formation flying")
    - Select the aircraft type (used when spawning AI aircraft in formation flights)
    - Aircraft types (name, number of engines, wingspan, ...) are constantly updated upon flight recordings
      * The default aircraft of FS 2020 are already in the logbook and hence immediatelly selectable when importing a CSV file
    - Also refer to new "time offset" feature in the Formation module which is useful to "synchronise multiplayer formation flights", see below
  * Export CSV plugin
  * Export KML plugin ("Google Earth")
    - Basic line style settings
    - Plugin settings are persisted in Sky Dolly application settings
  * SkyConnect plugin architecture
    - SimConnect plugin (currently FS2020 only)
    - Auto-detection of installed flight simulator (automatic plugin selection)
    - Plugin changeable at runtime via settings dialog
  
#### Modules

- Logbook
  * Filtering of flights 
    - By date via creation date tree widget
    - Search field which matches the flight title, user aircraft and destinations
    - Engine type (jet, piston, turboprop, ...)
    - Formation flights (flights having more than one aircraft)
  * The selected _user aircraft_ is now shown in the flight log table (previously: simply the first recorded aircraft of the formation was shown)
- Formation
  * A time offset can be added to the selected aircraft, effectively "shifting" it back or forth on the timeline
    - This is useful for "multiplayer formation flights" in order to synchronise the imported aircraft (also see CSV import plugin above)
  * A new "Fly with Formation" replay mode has been added:
    - All previously recorded aircraft are replayed
    - You fly with your currently loaded user aircraft with the formation ("in addition" to the recorded aircraft)
  * "Take control of recorded user aircraft" still exists
    - You can now switch control between user aircraft (also during replay), by double-clicking on the aircraft in the "Formation" table (or push the "Set User Aircraft" button)
  * Pause will now also "freeze" the user aircraft
    - For both "Fly with formation" and "Take control" replay modes
    - Additionally in "Fly with formation" replay mode user aircraft can be re-positioned relative to the _recorded_ user aircraft in the formation while paused, by clicking on one of the "relative positions"
  * Aircraft can now also be deleted from a formation flight during (paused) replay

### Improvements

- Better support for aircraft engine start & shutdown
- Additional simulation variables
  - Combustion
  - Smoke enabled/disabled (at the time of this writing not yet supported by FS2020)
- Database performance improvements:
  * "forward queries"
  * "Normalisation" of "aircraft type" data (new table - less storage space required)
- A new "View" menu has been added, providing options to show/hide various UI elements such as the module selector
- Logbook backup can now be scheduled, the logbook settings are now in the "File" menu
  * Once a month
  * Once a week
  * Daily
  * Never or whenever exiting Sky Dolly
- Older logbooks are not backed up before migration
  * This can be disabled in the new Logbook Settings (File/Logbook Settings...)
- User interface and usability refinments
  * "Active" icons
  * Small layout optimisations
  * Creating a new logbook now changes into parent directory of the actual logbook directory, when logbook file name (without extension) corresponds with the parent directory name
    - E.g. when creating a new logbook, when the existing one is "c:\Users\The User\Documents\Sky Dolly\Sky Dolly.sdlog", the file dialog will now start with "c:\Users\The User\Documents\"
    - (Previously: "c:\Users\The User\Documents\Sky Dolly\")
  * The replay speed group can now be hidden has well, just like the module selector
    - Both view options are now in the new View menu
    - Hiding the replay speed group and then switching into "minimal UI" mode (key M) allows for a truly minimalistic UI now
    - Note that the module selector and replay speed group view visibiliites cannot be toggled while in "minimal UI": switch to normal UI (key M) first
- Sky Dolly logbooks (*.sdlog) can now be associated with the Sky Dolly application: they will be opened upon double-click on the logbook (file)
  * Associating *.sdlog files with SkyDolly.exe needs to be manually done for now (right-click on file, "Open with...", choose SkyDolly.exe)
- Pressing the same shortcut for the Show Flight|Simulation Variables|Statistics (keys F, V and S respectively) now closes the corresonding dialog again

### Bug Fixes

- Proper "HiDPI support" on Windows

## 0.7.1

### Bug Fixes

- Only the database version is now read from the metadata table when comparing versions
  * Related metadata tables and columns may change in future versions, resulting in an SQL error when trying to read the entire metadata table

## 0.7.0

### New Features

- New module: Formation - record an unlimited number of aircraft and replay them altogher, with one single user interface
  * Simply add new aircraft to the formation by clicking the "record" button while in the Formation module (the plus (+) sign inidcates that aircraft are being added)
  * Previously recorded aircraft are replayed during recording of the new aircraft
  * Change the user aircraft (the one which is being followed by the camera) at any time during replay
  * Take control over the user aircraft any time during replay: manually fly it at any time (and give control back to replay at any time)
  * Delete aircraft from a formation
  * Set the position (relative to the current user aircraft) for the new aircraft to be recorded
- All aircraft are automatically persisted and added to the current flight
- The logbook now shows the number of aircraft per flight
- Start a new flight (starting with a single aircraft) by switching into the Logbook module
- The existing Simulation Variables and Flight dialogs show data about the currently selected user aircraft
- The module selector may be hidden
- Reduced data size of requested simulation variables

### Bug Fixes

- Make sure that the "delete flight" confirmation dialog is on top of the main window (specifically when the "stay on top" option is enabled)

## 0.6.3

### Bug Fixes

- Only the database version is now read from the metadata table when comparing versions
  * Related metadata tables and columns may change in future versions, resulting in an SQL error when trying to read the entire metadata table

## 0.6.2

### New Features

- The logbook (database) version is compared with the current Sky Dolly application version
  * Newer logbooks are not opened with older Sky Dolly applications
  * The user is offered the options to either create a new or open another (existing) logbook, or to cancel the operation

### Bug Fixes

- The logbook table (in the user interface) is cleared upon logbook (database) disconnection
- Decimal points in logbook file names are not "swallowed" anymore (e.g. "My Logbook v0.6.sdlog" is a perfectly fine filename)
- UI elements such as Record and CSV Import/Export are now properly enabled or disabled based on the logbook (database) connection status

## 0.6.1

### Bug Fixes

- Fix "logboog" typo in preview message
- Improve minimal UI switching
- Don't reset the elapsed time to 0 when unpausing a recording
- Keep displayed time when pausing a replay (don't set to total replay time)
- Automatically connect with simulator when seeking position
- Also pause the initially loaded flight
- When "repeat values" is enabled then also repeat values with "zero value" (e.g. "canopy closed")
- Automatically reconnect in case the SimConnect server (flight simulator) has crashed
- Also store the flight into the logbook if a paused recording is stopped
- Don't request SIMCONNECT_PERIOD_NEVER twice (e.g. when stopping a paused recording): prevent SIMCONNECT_EXCEPTION_UNRECOGNIZED_ID server exception
- Ensure that waypoints have distinct timestamp (prevent database unique constraint violation)

## 0.6.0

### New Features

- Add SQLite database support ("logbook") for persistence
  * Each flight is automatically persisted
  * Simple load / delete functionality
  * DB backup and optimisation functionality
- Simple logbook table which lists the recorded flights
- Each flight has an editable title and description
- The previous "Scenario" is now called a "Flight" ("Flight" dialog, shortcut key: F)
- Additional simulation variables support
  * Waypoints (ICAO, latitude/longitude/altitude) are shown in the order of approach; each waypoint is only counted once
  * Local and zulu simulation time
- Replay speed now also available in replay menu, including shortcuts: CTRL + [1 - 4] for slow motion, SHIFT + [1 - 5] for timelapse
- The custom replay speed factor can now be entered either as an absolute factor (1.0 = normal speed) or as percent (100% = normal speed)
- Remove "Yoke X|Y Position" simulation variables (not needed: yokes are still properly animated)
- Option to enable a "minimal UI" (shortcut key: M)
- The window geometry and state are persisted and restored upon application start

## 0.5.2

### New Features

- New "repeat values" settings for selected simulation variables have been introduced: canopy and flaps  
  * Certain aircraft counteract the requested simulation variables, e.g. the canopy closes or the flaps retract automatically
  * So with the "repeat" option enabled and if the given simulation variable has a value greater zero (e.g. "canopy open") then its value is repeatedly sent to Flight Simulator
  * The optimal settings are to disable the "repeat" options (in which case simulation variables are only sent when the value actually changes)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixes a crash which would occur when quitting the application and when the simulation variables dialog was still open
- Altitude and other simulation variables measured in feet are now properly displayed with their unit ('ft')
- Replaced the non-writeable FOLDING WING HANDLE POSITION simulation variable with FOLDING WING LEFT|RIGHT PERCENT

## 0.5.1

### Bug Fixes

- Properly parse the custom speed factor according to the current system locale (decimal delimiter may be , or .)
- The initial custom replay speed factor is now displayed with decimal places (e.g. 1.00 or 1,00 - to illustrate the expected decimal delimiter according to the system locale)
- Custom speed factor tooltip shows the valid value range
- Properly name simulation variable "Yoke X Position" (instead of Y)
- Simulation variables are now formatted according to the system locale

## 0.5.0

### New Features
- Simulation variables have been split into distinct requests, saving both on required space and CPU usage
- The replay speed is now a factor instead of percentage value (1 = normal speed, 2 = double speed etc.)
- Additional simulation variables: 
  * Cowl flaps
  * Electrical master battery
  * General engine starter
  * Folding wing handle
- Simulation variables now shown with units (feet, hPa, ...)
- Added a new "Flight" dialog, showing information about the aircraft and initial flight conditions
- The last CSV export/import directory is stored
- A basic error dialog shows when an import/export error occurs
- The seek interval can now be defined in the settings (either absolute in seconds, or in percent of the record duration)

## 0.4.2

### Bug Fixes

- Do not start the elapsed timer when seeking a play position and not in replay mode (replay does not "skip ahead" when started)

## 0.4.1

### Bug Fixes

- The time widget is now editable when replay is paused
- After importing a CSV file only pause when in connected state

- A new "auto" recording sample rate has been added 
  * Recording: samples are collected in an event-based manner ("as they arrive")
  * Replay: samples are always sent "per visual frame"
- Reorganise simulation variables in tabbed widget
- Add additional flight information variables, captured once at start of recording
  * Airline (Callsign)
  * Flight number
  * Tail number
  * Wing span
  * And more

### Bug Fixes

- Properly reset play position to begin after importing CSV data
- Validate the CSV data upon import: specifically the first timestamp must be 0 (timestamps are shifted accordingly)
- "Show simulation variables" action is now deselected when the dialog is closed (via close button)
- Set the initial start position ("on ground") when replay from (or seek to) start
- Prevent aircraft from "dropping out of the sky" after replay, by recording body velocities
