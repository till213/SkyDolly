## 0.2.0

### New Features

- Recording & playback of basic flight controls (rudder, ailerons, flaps, gear, ...)
- Updated user interface
- Separate simulation variables dialog
- Simulation variables are now also shown during replay (in the new simulation variables dialog)
- Add record/play/pause actions, with keyboard shortcuts (r = record, space = play, p = pause)

- Properly store the already elapsed time when changing the playback speed, for a smooth continuation of the replay
