# Sky Dolly
Sky Dolly - The Black Sheep for Your Flight Recordings.

## About
Sky Dolly connects to a running Flight Simulator 2020 instance and records various simulation variables, for replay.

![Sky Dolly v0.11.0](./img/SkyDolly-v0.11.0.png)

The connection is made via SimConnect, a standard API introduced with Flight Simulator X to connect with the flight simulator.

Aso refer to the [ABOUT.md](ABOUT.MD).

## Features
- Record / Pause / Play
- Formation flights (multiple aircraft, replay during recording, "fly with formation", time offset)
- Settable recording sample rate: fixed or variable ("auto")
- Adjustable replay speed ("slow motion", "timelapse"), replay loop
- Position, velocity and basic flight control simulation variables (ailerons, rudder, flaps, gears, ...) are recorded
- Plugin architecture with various import/export plugins (CSV, GPX, IGC, KML)
- Location module with over 100 default locations and import/export functionality
- Database (SQLite) based persistence ("logbook")

For more videos created with Sky Dolly also refer to [SHOWCASE](SHOWCASE.md). New and upcoming features are found in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

## Basic Usage

- Start a flight
- Click on "Record" (key R)
- You may pause recording (key P)
- Stop recording (key R) and click on "Play" (spacebar)
- Adjust the replay speed and seek the play position, also during replay
- Recorded flights are automatically persisted in the "logbook"
- Select a flight in the logbook and press "Load" (or double-click the row) to load the persisted flight

### Formation Recording & Replay

#### Recording

- Switch to the "Formation" module (key F2)
- Click on "Record" (key R)
- Each recorded aircraft is added to the current flight
- While existing aircraft are replayed during the recording with "auto" sample rate you may still change the recording sample rate 

#### Position

- The last recorded aircraft becomes the "user aircraft" (being followed by the camera in the flight simulator)
- Select a position relative to the current "user aircraft" before recording

#### Replay

- Simply click on "Play", "Pause" and seek in the timeline, just like with a single aircraft flight
- Change the "user aircraft" (also during replay) to "jump from cockpit to cockpit"
- Take control of the "user aircraft" by selecting either "Take control" or "Fly with Formation" option

#### Managing Formations

- You may delete single aircraft from a flight ("formation")
- There must be at least one aircraft per flight, so the last aircraft cannot be deleted
- Add a time offset to the selected aircraft ("multiplayer formation flight synchronisation")
- To start a new, single-aircraft flight change back to the "Logbook" module (key F1) and click on "Record" (key R)
