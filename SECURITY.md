# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Sky Dolly is still in active development. Minor bugs will be typically fixed in the next development ("preview") version, but major issues may also be downbranched to the previous version.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.18.x  | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.18  | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

You may report security issues via email (see git commits) instead of a git issue (which everyone would have access to).

Note that this is a personal project developed in my free time. As such there is no reaction time guarantee, or any guarantee really that I have the ability to fix the issue in time.

However I will try my best to at least give you a response, and in case the issue affects my own code I will try to fix it as soon as possible. In case of third-party libraries I will try to get hold of an updated library, but of course no promise can be made when - or even if - such an updated library may become available.
