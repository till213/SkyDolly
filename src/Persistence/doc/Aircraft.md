# Aircraft

The selectable aircraft are stored in table aircraft_type. Default aircraft, that is all aircraft of the MSFS Deluxe version and freely available aircraft by Asobo - are inserted at migration time, using the LogbookMigration.sql source.

## Adding new default aircraft

* Start Sky Dolly, create a new logbook
* In MSFS, enable Developer Mode
* Spawn at any airport (anyhwere)
* Open the Aircraft Selector dialog
* Select the aircraft to be added
* In Sky Dolly, quickly record a flight
* Repeat
