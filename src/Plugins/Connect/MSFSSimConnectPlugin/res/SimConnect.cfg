# This is the default Sky Dolly specific SimConnect client configuration.
# In Sky Dolly, go to File | Settings... | Flight Simulator and change
# the configuration (no restart required: Sky Dolly will reconnection
# automatically).
#
# All configurations work with the default SimConnect.xml server configuration
# that is located at:
#
# Steam: C:\Users\<user_name>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft Flight Simulator\
# Microsoft store: C:\Users\<user_name>\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.FlightSimulator_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalCache\
#
# However you may adjust the below IPv4 respectively IPv6 addresses and port numbers
# accordingly, in order to have MSFS and Sky Dolly run on different machines.
#
# For documentation about this SimConnect client configuration (SimConnect.cfg) also refer to:
